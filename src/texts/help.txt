Usage: `%PROGRAM_NAME% <verb> [switches]...` where <verb> is one of the following:
    `seal`: Encrypts and authenticates the incoming data-stream and writes it to stdout; supported switches:
        `--password=<string>` (OPTIONAL):
            The password to encrypt/decrypt the data; you must either specify a password using this switch or set it
            using the environment-variable "CRYPTO_PIPE_PASSWORD"

        `--pbkdf-time-cost=<integer>` (DEFAULT: 12):
            The time-cost (usually computational work) required to derive the key from the password

        `--pbkdf-memory-cost=<integer>` (DEFAULT: 512):
            The amount of memory required to derive the key from the password in MiB

        `--pbkdf-parallelism=<integer>` (DEFAULT: 4):
            The amount of threads required to derive the key from the password

        `--pbkdf-algo=<string>` (DEFAULT: "Argon2i"):
            The PBKDF-algorithm to use; supported algorithms are: "Argon2i"

        `--kdf-algo=<string>` (DEFAULT: "HMAC-SHA512"):
            The PBKDF-algorithm to use; supported algorithms are: "HMAC-SHA512"

        `--auth-enc-algo=<string>` (DEFAULT: "ChaChaPoly"):
            The authenticated-encryption algorithm; supported algorithms are: "ChaChaPoly"

    `open`: Verifies and decrypts the incoming data-stream and writes it to stdout; supported switches:
        `--password=<string>` (OPTIONAL):
            The password to encrypt/decrypt the data; you must either specify a password using this switch or set it
            using the environment-variable "CRYPTO_PIPE_PASSWORD"
